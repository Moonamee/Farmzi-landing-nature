# JavaScript

JavaScript code performs the following actions:

1. When you click on elements inside a block
with class "mobile div", the following happens:
Elements with class "mobile div" toggle class
"active". Elements with class "mobile nav"
switch class "open". Elements with class "mobile
nav ul" switch class "show".

2. The following happens in the loop: For each
li element inside the list with class "mobile
ul", a CSS style with a delay animation is
applied. The delay animation is calculated based
on the element index.

3. Next comes the code for the accordion: All
elements with class "accordion" are obtained. A
"click" event handler is added for each element.
When an element is clicked, the "active" class
is toggled and the next element (panel) is
displayed/hidden.

This code uses the jQuery library to work with
DOM elements and the Swiper plugin to create the
slider. It also contains code to create an
accordion without using jQuery.
